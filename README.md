## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔎 [Project A – IR / Search](https://github.com/your-repo-here)
Short, impact‑focused line about what this system does (e.g., “built a search engine over X documents with BM25 + learning‑to‑rank”).  
- Designed indexing and ranking pipeline; implemented query latency optimizations  
- Evaluated quality using IR metrics such as precision, recall, and nDCG

### 🤖 [Project B – ML / Modeling](https://github.com/your-repo-here)
Brief description (e.g., “trained and deployed an ML model for Y using real‑world data”).  
- Implemented data preprocessing, model training, and experiment tracking  
- Deployed an inference API and monitored performance

### 🏗️ [Project C – Systems / Infra](https://github.com/your-repo-here)
Brief description (e.g., “event‑driven system for Z with robust observability”).  
- Focus on architecture decisions, reliability, and throughput/latency numbers  
- Added logging/metrics and automated testing/CI

---

## 🧪 Experience

- **Research Assistant – UC Irvine**  
  Worked on problems at the intersection of ML and systems; contributed to experimental design, implementation, and analysis.

- **Tech Director – Student Organization**  
  Led the redesign of the ticketing and workflow system; owned architecture, performance tuning, and developer experience.

- **Software Engineering Intern – IIITDMJ**  
  Contributed to full‑stack features, debugging, and code quality improvements.
