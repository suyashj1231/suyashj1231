## 🚀 Featured Projects

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔎 Web Search Engine – Information Retrieval, Elasticsearch

- Developed a search engine from scratch, indexing 50,000+ documents with an inverted index and on‑disk partial indexing (3‑phase merge) to keep memory usage bounded while maintaining query latency under 300 ms without external libraries.  
- Implemented core IR techniques including TF‑IDF ranking, Boolean retrieval, Porter stemming, and tokenization, and boosted relevance using PageRank, HITS, and anchor‑text indexing for more precise ranking.

### 🖥️ OpenGL‑Based Terminal Emulator – GLAD, GLFW, FreeType (UNIX/Linux)

- Built a GPU‑accelerated terminal achieving 460 FPS on large text screens, reducing frame draw time to 2 ms and freeing over 80% of CPU resources for parallel workloads.  
- Delivered roughly 50% faster text output on datasets exceeding 700K lines, with smoother scrolling, lower input latency, and reduced system load compared to CPU‑rendered terminals.
